    <h1>About this project</h1>

    <p>This is a chronological map of the Los Angeles Metro rapid transit system. It provides an illustration of how the system has grown and evolved over the years.</p>

    <p>The goal of this project is to create a centralized vizualization of the changes that occurred and when they occurred. When I created it, there was no place to see this information in this manner - you could read about different metro lines and each of their changes, but it was difficult to tell when they occurred in relation to each other, both temporally and spatially.</p>

    <p>Additionally, my hope for this project is to help us appreciate how far we have come in a relatively short amount of time, to get us excited about upcoming expansions, and to inspire us to think of the potential for Los Angeles in the future.</p>

    <p>A few notes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This only includes <em>rapid</em> transit lines, both rail and bus, which I define as routes with a dedicated right-of-way. Generally, this means heavy-rail, light-rail, and bus rapid transit (BRT).</li>
      <li>Future projects are included as well, but only those that are under construction or have been planned under Measure R and Measure M funding.</li>
      <li>Dotted lines indicate routes with alignments that have yet to be confirmed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This site is in no way affiliated with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
